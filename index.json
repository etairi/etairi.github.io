It is a powerful primitive that even implies indistinguishability obfuscation (iO), given sufficiently compact ciphertexts (Ananth-Jain, CRYPTO'15 and Bitansky-Vaikuntanathan, FOCS'15). However, despite being extensively studied, there are FE schemes, such as function-hiding inner-product FE (Bishop-Jain-Kowalczyk, AC'15, Abdalla-Catalano-Fiore-Gay-Ursu, CRYPTO’18) and compact quadratic FE (Baltico-Catalano-Fiore-Gay, Lin, CRYPTO’17), that can be only realized using pairings. This raises whether there are some mathematical barriers which hinder us from realizing these FE schemes from other assumptions.\nIn this paper, we study the difficulty of constructing lattice-based compact FE. We generalize the impossibility results of Ünal (EC'20) for lattice-based function-hiding FE, and extend it to the case of compact FE. Concretely, we prove lower bounds for lattice-based compact FE schemes which meet some (natural) algebraic restrictions at encryption and decryption, and have messages and ciphertexts of constant dimensions. We see our results as important indications of why it is hard to construct lattice-based FE schemes for new functionalities, and which mathematical barriers have to be overcome.","tags":[],"title":"Lower Bounds for Lattice-based Compact Functional Encryption","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Valerio Cini","Sebastian Ramacher","Daniel Slamanig","Christoph Striecks","Erkan Tairi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1664394088,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664394088,"objectID":"575219397eb35e767a79e9a8379be937","permalink":"https://erkantairi.com/publication/inner-product-functional-encryption-with-updatable-ciphertexts/","publishdate":"2022-09-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/inner-product-functional-encryption-with-updatable-ciphertexts/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a novel variant of functional encryption which supports ciphertext updates, dubbed ciphertext updatable functional encryption (CUFE). Such a feature further broadens the practical applicability of the functional encryption paradigm and is carried out via so-called update tokens. However, allowing update tokens requires some care for the security definition as we want that updates can be done by any semi-trusted third party and only on ciphertexts. Our contribution is three-fold:\na) We define our new primitive with a security notion in the indistinguishability setting. Within CUFE, functional decryption keys and ciphertexts are labeled with tags such that only if the tag of the decryption key and the ciphertext match, then decryption succeeds. Furthermore, we allow ciphertexts to switch their tags to any other tag via update tokens. Such tokens are generated by the holder of the main secret key and can only be used in the desired direction. b) We present a generic construction of CUFE for any functionality as well as predicates different from equality testing on tags, which relies on the existence of (probabilistic) indistinguishability obfuscation (iO). c) We present a practical construction of CUFE for the inner-product functionality from standard assumptions (i.e., LWE) in the random-oracle model. On the technical level, we build on the recent functional encryption schemes with fine-grained access control and linear operations on encrypted data (Abdalla et al., AC'20) and introduce an additional ciphertext updatability feature. Proving security for such a construction turned out to be non-trivial, particularly when revealing keys for the updated challenge ciphertext is allowed. Overall, such construction enriches the set of known inner-product functional-encryption schemes with the additional updatability feature of ciphertexts.","tags":[],"title":"(Inner-Product) Functional Encryption with Updatable Ciphertexts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Noemi Glaeser","Matteo Maffei","Giulio Malavolta","Pedro Moreno-Sanchez","Erkan Tairi","Sri AravindaKrishnan Thyagarajan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1658426608,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658426608,"objectID":"63a9769e4d71a7a64c6295b6f90673c8","permalink":"https://erkantairi.com/publication/foundations-of-coin-mixing-services/","publishdate":"2022-07-21T18:03:28Z","relpermalink":"/publication/foundations-of-coin-mixing-services/","section":"publication","summary":"Coin mixing services allow users to mix their cryptocurrency coins and thus enable unlinkable payments in a way that prevents tracking of honest users' coins by both the service provider and the users themselves. The easy bootstrapping of new users and backwards compatibility with cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin) with limited support for scripts are attractive features of this architecture, which has recently gained considerable attention in both academia and industry.\nA recent work of Tairi et al. [IEEE S\u0026P 2021] formalizes the notion of a coin mixing service and proposes A2L, a new cryptographic protocol that simultaneously achieves high efficiency and interoperability. In this work, we identify a gap in their formal model and substantiate the issue by showing two concrete counterexamples: we show how to construct two encryption schemes that satisfy their definitions but lead to a completely insecure system.\nTo amend this situation, we investigate secure constructions of coin mixing services. First, we develop the notion of blind conditional signatures (BCS), which acts as the cryptographic core for coin mixing services. We propose game-based security definitions for BCS and propose A2L+, a modified version of the protocol by Tairi et al. that satisfies our security definitions. Our analysis is in an idealized model (akin to the algebraic group model) and assumes the hardness of the one-more discrete logarithm problem. Finally, we propose A2LUC, another construction of BCS that achieves the stronger notion of UC-security (in the standard model), albeit with a significant increase in computation cost. This suggests that constructing a coin mixing service protocol secure under composition requires more complex cryptographic machinery than initially thought.","tags":[],"title":"Foundations of Coin Mixing Services","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Erkan Tairi","Pedro Moreno-Sanchez","Matteo Maffei"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635326738,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635326738,"objectID":"e4bbbe64ef6ad62d71730f27aa1e17cd","permalink":"https://erkantairi.com/publication/post-quantum-adaptor-signature-for-privacy-preserving-off-chain-payments/","publishdate":"2021-12-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/post-quantum-adaptor-signature-for-privacy-preserving-off-chain-payments/","section":"publication","summary":"Adaptor signatures (AS) are an extension of digital signatures that enable the encoding of a cryptographic hard problem (e.g., discrete logarithm) within the signature itself. An AS scheme ensures that (i) the signature can be created only by the user knowing the solution to the cryptographic problem; (ii) the signature reveals the solution itself; (iii) the signature can be verified with the standard verification algorithm. These properties have made AS a salient building block for many blockchain applications, in particular, off-chain payment systems such as payment-channel networks, payment-channel hubs, atomic swaps or discrete log contracts. Current AS constructions, however, are not secure against adversaries with access to a quantum computer.\nIn this work, we present IAS, a construction for adaptor signatures that relies on standard cryptographic assumptions for isogenies, and builds upon the isogeny-based signature scheme CSI-FiSh. We formally prove the security of IAS against a quantum adversary. We have implemented IAS and our evaluation shows that IAS can be incorporated into current blockchains while requiring ∼1500 bytes of storage size on-chain and ∼140 milliseconds for digital signature verification. We also show how IAS can be seamlessly leveraged to build post-quantum off-chain payment applications without harming their security and privacy.","tags":[],"title":"Post-Quantum Adaptor Signature for Privacy-Preserving Off-Chain Payments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Erkan Tairi","Pedro Moreno-Sanchez","Matteo Maffei"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1634061808,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634061808,"objectID":"988852b55104e0522c05122769216ac6","permalink":"https://erkantairi.com/publication/a2l-anonymous-atomic-locks-for-scalability-in-payment-channel-hubs/","publishdate":"2021-12-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/a2l-anonymous-atomic-locks-for-scalability-in-payment-channel-hubs/","section":"publication","summary":"Payment channel hubs (PCHs) constitute a promising solution to the inherent scalability problems of blockchain technologies, allowing for off-chain payments between sender and receiver through an intermediary, called the tumbler. While state-of-the-art PCHs provide security and privacy guarantees against a malicious tumbler, they do so by relying on the scripting-based functionality available only at few cryptocurrencies, and they thus fall short of fundamental properties such as backwards compatibility and efficiency.\nIn this work, we present the first PCH protocol to achieve all aforementioned properties. Our PCH builds upon A2L, a novel cryptographic primitive that realizes a three-party protocol for conditional transactions, where the tumbler pays the receiver only if the latter solves a cryptographic challenge with the help of the sender, which implies the sender has paid the tumbler. We prove the security and privacy guarantees of A2L (which carry over to our PCH construction) in the Universal Composability framework and present a provably secure instantiation based on adaptor signatures and randomizable puzzles. We implemented A2L and compared it to TumbleBit, the state-of-the-art Bitcoin-compatible PCH. Asymptotically, A2L has a communication complexity that is constant, as opposed to linear in the security parameter like in TumbleBit. In practice, A2L requires ∼33x less bandwidth than TumleBit, while retaining the computational cost (or providing 2x speedup with a preprocessing technique). This demonstrates that A2L (and thus our PCH construction) is ready to be deployed today.\nIn theory, we demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to design a secure and privacy-preserving PCH while requiring only digital signatures and timelock functionality from the underlying scripting language. In practice, this result makes our PCH backwards compatible with virtually all cryptocurrencies available today, even those offering a highly restricted form of scripting language such as Ripple or Stellar. The practical appealing of our construction has resulted in a proof-of-concept implementation in the COMIT Network, a blockchain technology focused on cross-currency payments.","tags":[],"title":"A2L: Anonymous Atomic Locks for Scalability in Payment Channel Hubs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Valerio Cini","Sebastian Ramacher","Daniel Slamanig","Christoph Striecks","Erkan Tairi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1627213705,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627213705,"objectID":"7bccaeb16abad8bc1b86b71ce4f03445","permalink":"https://erkantairi.com/publication/updatable-signatures-and-message-authentication-codes/","publishdate":"2021-12-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/updatable-signatures-and-message-authentication-codes/","section":"publication","summary":"Cryptographic objects with updating capabilities have been proposed by Bellare, Goldreich and Goldwasser (CRYPTO'94) under the umbrella of incremental cryptography. They have recently seen increased interest, motivated by theoretical questions (Ananth et al., EC'17) as well as concrete practical motivations (Lehmann et al., EC'18; Groth et al. CRYPTO'18; Klooss et al., EC'19). In this work, the form of updatability we are particularly interested in is that primitives are key-updatable and allow to update old cryptographic objects, e.g., signatures or message authentication codes, from the old key to the updated key at the same time without requiring full access to the new key (i.e., only via a so-called update token).\nInspired by the rigorous study of updatable encryption by Lehmann and Tackmann (EC'18) and Boyd et al. (CRYPTO'20), we introduce a definitional framework for updatable signatures (USs) and message authentication codes (UMACs). We discuss several applications demonstrating that such primitives can be useful in practical applications, especially around key rotation in various domains, as well as serve as building blocks in other cryptographic schemes. We then turn to constructions and our focus there is on ones that are secure and practically efficient. In particular, we provide generic constructions from key-homomorphic primitives (signatures and PRFs) as well as direct constructions. This allows us to instantiate these primitives from various assumptions such as DDH or CDH (latter in bilinear groups), or the (R)LWE and the SIS assumptions. As an example, we obtain highly practical US schemes from BLS signatures or UMAC schemes from the Naor-Pinkas-Reingold PRF.","tags":[],"title":"Updatable Signatures and Message Authentication Codes","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1621987200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621987200,"objectID":"adbe637c23521239eaf42e24eb071061","permalink":"https://erkantairi.com/talk/a2l-anonymous-atomic-locks-for-scalability-in-payment-channel-hubs/","publishdate":"2021-12-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/a2l-anonymous-atomic-locks-for-scalability-in-payment-channel-hubs/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A2L: Anonymous Atomic Locks for Scalability in Payment Channel Hubs","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1620604800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620604800,"objectID":"e79967495f175fc16a489c8d3481273c","permalink":"https://erkantairi.com/talk/updatable-signatures-and-message-authentication-codes/","publishdate":"2021-12-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/updatable-signatures-and-message-authentication-codes/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Updatable Signatures and Message Authentication Codes","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614729600,"objectID":"bd26d879691cddfe667fd297d3282e99","permalink":"https://erkantairi.com/talk/post-quantum-adaptor-signature-for-privacy-preserving-off-chain-payments/","publishdate":"2021-12-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/post-quantum-adaptor-signature-for-privacy-preserving-off-chain-payments/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Post-Quantum Adaptor Signature for Privacy-Preserving Off-Chain Payments","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://erkantairi.com/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
